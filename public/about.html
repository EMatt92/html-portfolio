<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eric Matthews.  I am a web developer in training.  I just started learning how to code in October 2024.  I have huge ambitions to learn as much as I can about this field so that I can support myself and my family.  My family motivated me to get started and they will strengthen me through this process, along with the help of God.  So far, I am extremely confident and encouraged with what I have learned so far.  This portfolio should showcase everything I have learned up to this point.</p>
<p>As a new web developer, I am pretty comfortable with a computer already.  I am brand new with coding, but I have been tech savvy ever since I've been introduced to computers as a child.  I loved playing video games as a kid, and I still do.  This also contributed to how I could easily understand how things worked after a few minutes of messing around.  In the games, I would press random buttons to figure out all the possibilities.  On the computer, I would always be on the hunt for cool little things to do.  I used to love going into Paint, making a picture, and then turning it into a wallpaper.  </p>
<p>Apart from playing video games and messing around on the computer, I love being active and playing sports.  This has been true about me ever since I was a child.  My favorite sport is baseball, but I would play anything and try anything if it meant I could test my skills and compete against others.  This gave me confidence and aspirations to be better than everyone else.  Of course in life, you learn that eventually there will be someone better than you, but that hunger to be the best still exists deep within me.  I use this as motivation in everything that I do.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, I want to thank you for taking the time to read through it.  I hope you've gotten to know me a little bit better.  I also hope I've gotten you invested in my journey.  If you have, I would invite you to check back here from time to time to see how I'm doing.  I plan to update this periodically.  This is just a project for my classes at the moment, but one day it might become my actual portfolio that gets me a job as a web developer.  Only time will tell.  If you're a friend or family member, thank you for being a part of who I am.  If you don't know me, thank you for visiting this website.
