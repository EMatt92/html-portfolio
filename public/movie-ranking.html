<h1>Eric's Top 3 Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies of all time, in no particular order!</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>This was the first movie I owned on VHS. (I know, I'm old.) I watched it over and over as a kid, and memorized almost the whole thing!</p>
<h3>The Lost World of Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>This is the second movie in the original trilogy.  It featured the T-Rex the most out of the three movies, which is my favorite dinosaur!</p>
<h3>2 Fast 2 Furious</h3>
<p>This is the second movie in the Fast and Furious franchise.  It introduced Roman Peirce and Tej Parker, which are two of my favorite characters!</p>
